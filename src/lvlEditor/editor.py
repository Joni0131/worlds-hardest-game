    # first init a field of playable tiles width = 20 height = 10
    # that means in reality there are 22*12 tiles
    # set the others as out of bounds
    # set certain keys for actions:
        # remove tile from playing field on click
        # set start
        # set goal
        # set start enemyPos all enemies are always starting and stopping in the middle of a tile
        # set enemyAim points add transparent enemy draw, so it can be seen
        # detect edges and add to corresponding tile
            # draw edges afterwards
        # save level
            # ask for initial level name
    # close editor
