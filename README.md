# worlds-hardest-game
This repo trys to implement a evolutinary / genetic algorithm for the worlds hardest game.  
This idea was inspiered by CodeBullet https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeBullet/videos?app=desktop&cbrd=1  
To write this in python first the game has to be recreated. To do this the following repositirys were used as a base and the necasary changes were done by me.  
1.https://github.com/zigcBenx/worlds-hardest-game   
2.https://github.com/nicholaslantz/worlds-hardest-game
3.https://github.com/Code-Bullet/WorldsHardestGameAI  
Hopefully you don't mind if yes please let me know.
